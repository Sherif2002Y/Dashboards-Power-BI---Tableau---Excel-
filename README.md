## 📊 Project 1: Power BI - Sales Activities Dashboard
### [View Project Screenshots](https://github.com/Sherif2002Y/Dashboards-Power-BI---Tableau---Excel-/tree/main/Sales%20Dashboard%20%26%20RFM%20Model/Screenshots)

### **Description**
This project involved building a full-scale Business Intelligence solution to analyze sales performance and customer loyalty. I transformed a disorganized dataset into a structured **Star Schema** model, allowing for advanced **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation**. The final result is a series of interactive dashboards that provide "Actionable Insights" for marketing and sales strategy.

### **Key Technical Skills**
* **Data Modeling:** Designed and implemented a **Star Schema** architecture with 1:Many relationships to ensure data integrity and high-speed reporting.
* **RFM Segmentation:** Developed a behavioral scoring model to categorize customers into 11 actionable segments (e.g., Champions, At Risk, Lost).
* **Advanced DAX:** Authored complex measures for Time-Intelligence (YoY Growth), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), Churn Rate, and Retention metrics.
* **ETL & Data Cleaning:** Used **Power Query (M Language)** to clean, pivot, and merge raw sales data, handling inconsistencies and null values.
* **Forecasting & Analytics:** Integrated "What-If" parameters to simulate sales forecasting and used Decomposition Trees for root-cause analysis.

### **Tools Used**
* **Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, DAX authoring, and visualization.
* **Power Query:** For the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process.
* **Star Schema:** For optimized data architecture.
* **Microsoft Azure:** Integration for map-based geographic analysis.

**Description:** A robust Excel-based tool developed to process and visualize business data without heavy software. This project demonstrates the power of Excel for automated data modeling and reporting.

**Key Technical Skills:**
* **Pivot Tables & Charts:** Dynamic summaries of large datasets.
* **Advanced Formulas:** Used `XLOOKUP`, `INDEX/MATCH`, and `IFS` for automated logic.
* **Data Cleaning:** Used Power Query within Excel to automate the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Advanced).
