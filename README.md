# Dashboards: Power BI - Tableau - Excel

# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains my projects across **Power BI**, **Tableau**, and **Excel**, showcasing my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize complex data.

## 📊 Project 1: Power BI - Sales Activities Dashboard
### [View Project](https://github.com/Sherif2002Y/Dashboards-Power-BI---Tableau---Excel-/blob/main/Sales%20Dashboard%20%26%20RFM%20Model/READMe.md) / [Screenshots](https://github.com/Sherif2002Y/Dashboards-Power-BI---Tableau---Excel-/tree/main/Sales%20Dashboard%20%26%20RFM%20Model/Screenshots)

### **Description**
This project involved building a full-scale Business Intelligence solution to analyze sales performance and customer loyalty. I transformed a disorganized dataset into a structured **Star Schema** model, allowing for advanced **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation**. The final result is a series of interactive dashboards that provide "Actionable Insights" for marketing and sales strategy.

### **Key Technical Skills**
* **Data Modeling:** Designed and implemented a **Star Schema** architecture with 1:Many relationships to ensure data integrity and high-speed reporting.
* **RFM Segmentation:** Developed a behavioral scoring model to categorize customers into 11 actionable segments (e.g., Champions, At Risk, Lost).
* **Advanced DAX:** Authored complex measures for Time-Intelligence (YoY Growth), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), Churn Rate, and Retention metrics.
* **ETL & Data Cleaning:** Used **Power Query (M Language)** to clean, pivot, and merge raw sales data, handling inconsistencies and null values.
* **Forecasting & Analytics:** Integrated "What-If" parameters to simulate sales forecasting and used Decomposition Trees for root-cause analysis.

### **Tools Used**
* **Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, DAX authoring, and visualization.
* **Power Query:** For the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process.
* **Star Schema:** For optimized data architecture.
* **Microsoft Azure:** Integration for map-based geographic analysis.

## 📈 Project 2: Tableau - Retail Data Storytelling - Dashboard
### [View Project](https://github.com/Sherif2002Y/Dashboards-Power-BI---Tableau---Excel-/blob/main/Retail%20Data%20Storytelling%20-%20Dashboard/READMe.md) / [View Project on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/SaleswithConnections/CustomerDashboard?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

### **Description**
An applied Tableau project focused on transforming raw retail data into interactive dashboards that highlight sales performance, customer behavior, and key business insights through data storytelling.

### **Key Technical Skills**
* **Calculated Fields & YoY Analysis:** Built custom metrics to compare current performance with previous years.
* **LOD Expressions:** Controlled calculation granularity to ensure accurate KPIs regardless of filters.
* **Data Modeling (Fact & Dimension Tables):** Organized data for performance, consistency, and scalability.
* **Dashboard UX & Data Storytelling:** Presented insights clearly to support fast, data-driven decisions.

### **Tools Used**
Tableau Desktop, Tableau Public.
